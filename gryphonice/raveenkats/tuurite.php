  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>&quot;He can Soul-read, and can teleport at will thanks to a Magic Amulet 
    which has merged with him. His wings are fully flight-capable. The jewels 
    on his body are part of his skeletal system, and thus cannot be removed. They 
    can be cracked, but it takes a lot of strength behind a physical blow to do 
    such a thing.&quot;</p>
  <h2>Abilities</h2>
  <p>Destiny's Fate: Ability to freeze time for as long as the user desires.</p>
  <p>Touch of Fate: Ability to freeze the target in time by means of touch. The 
    target will basically be frozen in place, and won't be able to move until 
    the user desires them to be unfrozen.</p>
