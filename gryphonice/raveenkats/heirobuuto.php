  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>&quot;He is not a nice Kat at all ^^; He'd rather cause pain to some beast 
    then sit around chatting. He has a gold hilted dagger thrusted through his 
    neck (you can see the blade in the pic), and a broken arrow thrusted through 
    his left back leg. All of his claws are twisted and extremely sharp. His entire 
    body is stitched together, but cannot be pulled apart. He is immune to all 
    instant kill abilities and paralyzing abilities. He enjoys pain, so it really 
    doesn't bother him. His tail is more reptillian then feline, and a slight 
    mutation. He has vampire fangs, but is not a vampire. Both of his eyes are 
    dark red and do not reflect light.&quot;</p>
  <p>He has been killed once by <a href="http://kynn.lostmysanity.net/Nessus/Stats-Zoratsuu.html">Zoratsuu</a></p>
