      <td>Tiny dragons(8-9 inches long) with full flight capibilities. They eat 
        mostly berries and insects, but never object to a bit of candy or meat. 
        Because of their small size, minikin dragons are usually sold in threes, 
        and breeding trios at that. These tiny creatures aren't very intelligent, 
        but recognize their owner as a source of food, comefort, and protection, 
        almost like a dog. They frequently perch on their owner's shoulders, arms, 
        or even head and when traind properly, can be taught to deliver messages. 
        No one knows what the little bob on their head is for, but it sure is 
        cute ^_^; As the number of captive minikins increases, owners try to breed 
        for designer colors when they can, though clutches are few and far between.</td>
