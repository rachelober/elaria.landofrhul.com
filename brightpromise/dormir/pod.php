  <p>&quot;Welcome to the Den of Alsan's Trees!&quot; a little voice calls. &quot;We 
    were the first registered den and we are run by Bright Promise of Hearth.&quot; 
    Looking around, you see a red female swishing her long, silky tail back and 
    forth. &quot;Were you interested in joining us? Maybe your owner wanted to 
    foster from us?&quot;</p>

    records up to date.</p>
