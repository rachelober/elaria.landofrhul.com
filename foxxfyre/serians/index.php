      <p>The soft light of the early morning falls upon your face. The grass is 
        wet with a sweet dew that desprately clings to the last threads of grass 
        before the rising sun comes to burn them away. No human is awake to see 
        the wonders of this morning, but life springs up from their slumber as 
        the sun points its heavenly fingers and gently wakes them, one by one.</p>
      <p>The sound of laughter can be heard over the slow rise and dip of the 
        hillside. Music accompanies this moment, and it starts off quiet and then 
        crescendos into a loud orchestra of rings and beats.</p>
