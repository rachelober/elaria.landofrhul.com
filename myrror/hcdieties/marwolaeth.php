      <td>Can 'revive' any corpse into an unlife, the undead creature will follow 
        any commands this diety tells them. There is no limit to how bad the corpse's 
        condition is, as long as there is at least bones, he can work with it. 
        He can do this permanently to a wolf to mountain-lion-sized creature once 
        a day, any others will turn to dust after 24 hours. Due to this, he probably 
        won't 'revive' any more corpses than he has power to unless he needs a 
        quick army.<br>
        <br>
        He can also do this to fossilized bones, but this takes more energy--he's 
        limited to rabbit to housecat sized with those. Of course, he can save 
        up his energy to use on the larger creatures. (and as long as you've had 
        him, he's probably saved up enough energy to revive a pack of fossilized 
        dinosaurs) </td>
