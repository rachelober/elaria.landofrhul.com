    <h1>Other Realms</h1>
    <p>Bright Promise directed all the workers to a portal area close by. She 
      had maybe 50 cats she had to bring back to the other realm for adoption 
      by other people because of the over breeding.</p>
    <p>They got to the gate, which was protected by this canine looking creature 
      with a huge scythe. He was about 7 feet tall and stood on two legs and dressed 
      as if he were human, or as human as a canine could get. His legs were like 
      a canine's but bent so that he could walk on two legs. His front arms were 
      designed like a human's but had thick fingers, mutated from paws. The creature 
      also had a long snout and a lot of fur.</p>
    <p>Bright faced the creature and he snorted in her direction. She bowed her 
      head slowly, still looking directly into his eyes. He huffed and lowered 
      his weapon in his left paw and motioned gruffly with his other paw for the 
      group to enter quickly.</p>
    <p>It was a Realm agreement that all portals would have a guard at them and 
      only certain individuals could make their way through and usually you had 
      to make reservations in advance to make travel. Luckily, Bright was one 
      of them allowed to travel. She was even on the committee to train the beasts 
      that guard them and knew how to handle them.</p>
    <p>Pyyon stayed in the back of the line to make sure everyone made it through 
      alright. The group made it through the portal safely and was greeted by 
      a towering figure, a blue figure nonetheless, with no hair and tendrils 
      that fell over his mouth. He burbled out to Bright Promise, &quot;And whhooo 
      are youuuu?&quot;</p>
    <p>She had to hold back a laugh, needed to get use to this species' habits 
      again, &quot;I am Bright Promise of Hearth from Rhul. I've come to deliver 
      these cats back to the original breeder for new placement.&quot; She motioned 
      with her right hand the many caged felines.</p>
    <p>&quot;And whooooo gave you the ok to come into our territory?&quot; he 
      burbled back.</p>
    <p>Pyyon snuck into the area and flew overhead into one of the rafters within 
      the building that the portal opened up into and watched the proceedings 
      from above.</p>
    <p>&quot;Anakroid gave me safe passage here. He said he would meet me in this 
      spot on this day at this time. Look, I have the papers all approved and 
      signed,&quot; she reached into her handbag and a man called from the back 
      of the line.</p>
    <p>&quot;UUhhh, hey Bright, this one is waking up.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Shh shh, we are almost done! Give me a second to deal with the officer!&quot;</p>
    <p>The large cat from earlier had obviously not received enough of the sedative 
      and began to wake up too early, and he was mad. He began to pace in his 
      cage as Bright fumbled around with papers. &quot;I just know it is in here.&quot;</p>
    <p>The large officer gazed down annoyed.</p>
    <p>The men at the back began to swarm the area as it looked like the hinges 
      of the cage were not going to handle it. The cat took a large swipe at a 
      man who got to close and sliced right through his clothing and skin. He 
      cried in pain and moved away from the cage. Many of the smaller men dispersed 
      and other patrons of the transport facility began to run away. One more 
      knock and the cat was free from its cage.</p>
    <p>Bright Promise looked back just in time to see the cat run off into the 
      station atrium. she turn around and ripped her purse from her shoulder and 
      threw her head into the air growling, &quot;Oh fu-&quot;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/hr.gif" alt="" width="261" height="40"></p>
    <p>A gavel banged on the King's desk as Bright Promise and the men in charge 
      of holding that cat back were held in front of the public by rope around 
      their arms, string them tightly to the wall. The audience in the King's 
      throne room murmured to themselves about this crazy and tragic incident.</p>
    <p>&quot;Bright Prooomise,&quot; the King started. &quot;You have been charged 
      with reckless endangerment of our peoples within a crowded environment. 
      How do you plead?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;Not guilty,&quot; she asserted, &quot;It was an accident.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;That cat was set lose and killed 20 of our people and injured nearly 
      100.&quot;</p>
    <p>Bright Promise held her head low, disappointed. She wondered where Pyyon 
      had got herself off to and how she was going to get out of THIS one.</p>
    <p>During the scramble, Pyyon flew to get a good idea of where the cat was 
      heading. When he started to kill, she flew back into the rafters and held 
      her wings over her ears to drown out the screaming and closed her eyes tightly, 
      trying to imagine herself somewhere different. Now, she was ashamed and 
      beating herself up for her inaction. She was in the court room hidden in 
      one of the rafters and staying quiet.</p>
    <p>The court went on and they interviewed witness after witness and the King 
      looked on, very upset and very disagreeable. &quot;I will deliberate on 
      this case for a brief time, we will meet in 2 hours after a recess,&quot; 
      and a slam from the gavel ended the trial.</p>
    <p>The King walked from his throne through a small door behind his desk. Following 
      him was a bright yellow terran dragon. Pyyon cocked her head to the side. 
      *Is that a Bishel?* she wondered and decided to investigate. In the clamor 
      of the court room, Pyyon flew overhead and quickly followed the pair as 
      they made their way through.</p>
    <p>She hid behind a plant as the King slowly walked down the hall with the 
      bright yellow Bishel somewhat lagging behind, looking around, thinking that 
      something was around.</p>
    <p>*Crap,* Pyyon thought, *She knows I'm here...*</p>
    <p>But the Bishel just turned her head back to the front and followed the 
      King. He bent over to the dragon and stated, &quot;I must spend some time 
      going over some things, you know. Why don't you hang around a bit and I 
      will meet up with you soon for lunch?&quot;</p>
    <p>The Bishel nodded her head and stepped around as the King walked into an 
      office and shut the door. She sighed and looked bored.</p>
    <p>Pyyon stepped out behind the plant and slithered over to the terran, surprising 
      her.</p>
    <p>*Who-who are you?* a common greeting in this land, the yellow Bishel said.</p>
    <p>Pyyon gulped and tried not to be nervous, *Pyyon, from Rhul.*</p>
    <p>The yellow Bishel narrowed her eyes, *From Rhul, eh? Why aren't you locked 
      up with your other friends and awaiting the verdicts?* and made a motion 
      to escape and possibly alert someone.</p>
    <p>*Wait, wait, please, sister, I must beg you. Do not alert anyone!*</p>
    <p>Intrigued, the Bishen stopped and looked at Pyyon, *Why, what is it that 
      you plead to me?*</p>
    <p>She frowned and plead, *Sister,*</p>
    <p>*My name is Annova,*</p>
    <p>*Annova,* Pyyon began again, *These people mean no harm.*</p>
    <p>*But they caused it anyway!* Annova spit back.</p>
    <p>*They came to help your people, Annova. Can't you realize that? Sometimes 
      mistakes happen.*</p>
    <p>*Mistakes that cost life, are not mistakes, they are tragedies.*</p>
    <p>Pyyon tried to reason with Annova, *Let me reason with you, you and I are 
      both Bishen. I wouldn't be coming to you unless I was speaking the Truth. 
      I had my Shantel, I do good works in the name of the Realm and I will vouch 
      for these prisoners.* Pyyon held out her Branch of Plenty and created a 
      fruit of Peace to place in one of Annova's claws.</p>
    <p>She gazed down at the fruit, impressed. *I will listen to you, Pyyon.*</p>
    <p>Pyyon discussed the work Bright Promise was doing and why she was here. 
      All along praising her works and her own bondmate. *As you can see, wise 
      Bishen, we mean no harm, this was a tragic event that affected us as well. 
      My people do not need to be in those cages and sent to death, instead let 
      me take them back to Rhul as quickly as possible.*</p>
    <p>Annova nodded her head, *I cannot make this choice, but I can talk with 
      the King, he makes the decision.*</p>
    <p>Pyyon bowed her head in respect, *Whatever you can do to save these men 
      and Bright Promise, I will be in debt to you and your King.*</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/hr.gif" alt="" width="261" height="40"></p>
    <p>The gavel once again pounded on the desk as the King stepped into his seat. 
      &quot;Hear ye, hear ye.&quot; The sound in the court room did not dull, 
      and neither did the King's voice. &quot;Let me speak you mangy public. Shut 
      yer traps!&quot; As it would seem, this place hadn't much formality- at 
      least the room quieted down to a dull mumur. &quot;That's right. Now, listen! 
      In the case of the endangerment, I have ruled that Bright Promise and her 
      working crew are to finish their transaction with the appropriate officials 
      and then return to Rhul promptly. They will not be allowed back into the 
      Realm for an indefinite amount of time.&quot; He banged his gavel once more 
      and then stood up.</p>
    <p>An uproar released itself into the room as angry patrons began to exit 
      the court.</p>
    <p>Pyyon caught the eye of Annova. *Thank you*.</p>
    <p>Annova winked and walked away with the King.</p>
    <p>One of the guards cut down Bright and the other men. Pyyon flew from the 
      rafters to meet with Bright Promise.</p>
    <p>&quot;Was that a Bishel I saw?&quot; Bright asked Pyyon as she rubbed her 
      sore wrists.</p>
    <p>Pyyon nodded with a smile on her face, very proud of herself. *You betcha!*</p>
    <p>Bright gave a coy smile to the Bishen. *What did you do? You know... you 
      could have gotten yourself into trouble too!*</p>
    <p>Pyyon's lightheartedness dampened a bit.</p>
    <p>&quot;... but of course, what is life without a few surprises?&quot; Bright 
      said and patted Pyyon on the head. &quot;C'mon, let's finish our transaction 
      and head home.&quot;</p>
