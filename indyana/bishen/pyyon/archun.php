    <p align="center"><img src="images/archun.gif" width="60" height="150"></p>
    <p>Archun is a mysterious creature. Is he really what he tells Bright Promise 
      he is? Out of nowhere, he comes into Bright Promise's life when she is a 
      child and watches over her at night in her bedroom. As she grew, he never 
      aged, never once gave the impression of wear. Even outlived his expiration 
      date and witnessed Bright's parent's deaths from an inherited disease that 
      Bright is almost guaranteed to befall the same.</p>
    <p>Archun keeps his alternate life a secret from Pyyon. He didn't think he 
      needed to tell her and worry her for the potential danger he is in for being 
      a major player in the well being of Rhul as a whole. Eventually, hard times, 
      which are hidden from the public of Rhul, alerts Archun and he must travel 
      to the north to battle.</p>
    <p>There, he is grouped with other powerful forces of Rhul in a battle against 
      a terrible evil that has reared itself in the northern lands. The details 
      of the battle are not discussed extensively in this story but does cause 
      major pain for Pyyon as she must wait for him to return- she cannot come 
      with him nor even when she goes to look for him, able to find this secret 
      battleground.</p>
    <p>He returns to Pyyon and Bright, damaged and must confess to Pyyon his life 
      and tel of a few secrets of the world she lives in.</p>
