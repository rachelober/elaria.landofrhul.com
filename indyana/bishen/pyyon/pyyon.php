      is a caring individual who is extremely self conscious about her powers 
      and her ability to help others. She loves plants and life and of course, 
      creating it. Unfortunately, she hasn't had the opportunity to help anyone 
      to a great measure and her own project with Bright Promise and Archun almost 
      failed.</p>
    <p align="left">Bright Promise and Archun assured her that her powers were 
      very important and that maybe she should train to improve her skills. She 
      rarely uses her Branch of Plenty unless in dire cases.</p>
    <p align="left">Unexpected events makes it hard for Archun to stay around 
      hearth anymore and for a time he must disappear. Pyyon is crushed by this 
      and enters into a state of depression and spends most of her days lounging 
      in a tree outside of Bright Promise's house. She tries to make her self 
      unseen by anyone other than Bright Promise in fear that the townsfolk will 
      treat her the same way they treated Archun, because he was different.</p>
    <p align="left">One day, she travels to Northern Rhul in a burst of confidence 
      to search for Archun. Instead, she finds <a href="moschata.php">another 
      green Bishen</a>. He has a deep understanding of plants and helps her realize 
      her potential with her gift. She falls deeply in love with this older Bishen 
      and pledges her life to him.</p>
