      Dragons seem to have many Clans other than those that are adopted out of 
      the Bishen Realm such as the Machesri and the Hirgyae Clans. This has been 
      proven with the new influx of &quot;Portal&quot; Bishen that come from other 
      lands and somehow end up in the hands of caretakers/bondmates.</p>
    <p>Each Clan has its specific customs and honors, the Sendiora Bishen are 
      no different. They come from a world much different than anything you or 
      I would know. No humans exist within their territories, so it is unheard 
      of that these beast would have to rely on a human (or creature for that 
      matter) to defend or feed them.</p>
    <p>However, one day a portal between the worlds of Sendiora and Rhul opened 
      up and a white tree sprouted from the green grass on the other side and 
      its roots kept the portal open for much longer than desired... for each 
      of the realms on either side.</p>
    <p>This site is dedicated to the Clan of Sendiora Bishen, and maybe one day 
      more of them would be adopted out! XD</p>
