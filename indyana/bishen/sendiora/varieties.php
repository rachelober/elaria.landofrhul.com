    <h1>Varieties</h1>
    <h2> Colors...</h2>
    <p><b>White</b>: Sendiora dragons pretty much only come in white. They are 
      true fighters fighting for the survival of their Clan. Even though trained 
      in battle, they are trustworthy creatures with a lot of honor.</p>
    <p><b>Light Violet</b>: The light violet color is rare and is usually a sign 
      of royalty. Many light violet dragons quickly ascend to higher positions 
      within the army or even may one day become the Ameunda of the Clan.</p>
    <p><b>Mutations</b>: Because of the new law governing Sendiora dragon eggs 
      to be sent to other realms, who knows what sort of mutation may arise from 
      other climates. </p>
    <h2>Types...</h2>
    <p><b>Terran</b>: Terran dragons have four legs and no wings. They live in 
      the forest areas and prefer to live around trees and plantlife. Terrans 
      are the basic soliders of the army, and extremely skilled in warfare with 
      their horns.</p>
    <p><b>Arboreal</b>: Arboreal dragons have two wings and a pair of back legs. 
      They prefer the nighttime and will fly more often than walk. They are important 
      assets to the army for their ability to fly above the crowd and sense danger.</p>
    <p><b>Marine</b>: Marine dragons have no wings and no legs. They lives around 
      ponds and swampy areas. They are usually in positions of deplomacy or caretaking 
      positions within the army.</p>
