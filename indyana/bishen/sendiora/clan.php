    <h1>General Information</h1>
    <p> Sendiora Bishen are very rare to be adopted out at the Realm, but the 
      Ameunda has allowed some to be adopted out to propagate the species outside 
      of their realm. They are intelligent creatures just like the Machesri Bishen 
      but usually have one track minds.</p>
    <p>The dragons usually get to be the size of horses but size varies depending 
      on the variety of the dragon. Usually Terran-types are larger, then the 
      Arboreal-types, with Marine-types usually the smallest.</p>
    <p>Sendiora Bishen usually like to meet prideful creatures in order to make 
      alliances and to gather information of potential &quot;enemies&quot;. It 
      is usually not characteristic that a Sendiora Bishen will make friends just 
      for the sake of being friends.</p>
    <p>Sendioras are born as eggs with male eggs white with purple dot patterns 
      and females marked purple with white markings.</p>
    <p>When the eggs are hatched, the wyrm emerges. The wyrm will already be outfitted 
      with a small white horn and and a growing mane. Male will have white manes 
      whereas females will have light purple manes to match their eyes. Most often, 
      wyrms will be born with many spikes along their backs and tails for defense.</p>
    <p>The dragon's next growth stage is the shrape stage. At this age, they will 
      have developed a full mane as well as limbs that determine their status 
      within the community. The three main types are Terran-type, Arboreal-type, 
      and Marine-type.</p>
    <p>Their final stage of growth happens in a very large ceremony conducted 
      by the Ameunda. He/she will award the dragon a piece of Sendiora Shard which 
      will channel their magic and help them become stronger fighters.</p>
    <p>At this point they are full members of Sendiora culture and the army, ready 
      to defend the republic. After this, the dragons may take on mates and clutch, 
      keeping the same mate for the rest of their life. Females usually produce 
      2-5 eggs each clutch. At this age, the dragon may also train further to 
      gain more Sendioran Shards to build their power.</p>
