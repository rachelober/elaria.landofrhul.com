    <p>Misfortunte is one who likes to party. He loves getting into messes and 
      especially causing them. If you would invite him to a party he would be 
      the first to be drunk and passed out on the ground infront of the door way.</p>
    <p>Most Atash Bin Nidels are like this, so Misfortunte is no exception, but 
      he does take things to extremes. The Atash Bin Nidels are not intelligent 
      peoples, most of the time they do not have intelligent language either, 
      mostly speaking in gibberish with the tone of their voice mainly expressing 
      how they feel or think.</p>
    <p>Misfortunte lies, steals and makes trouble. He finds an egg one day when 
      he is out scrounging and decides he will take it back to his burrow to eat. 
      Unfortunately, for him, the egg starts to hatch and out pops a little Hirgyae 
      wyrm. Misfortunte laughs at the creature and calls him &quot;strange bones&quot;.</p>
    <p>Together with Ghal'pia'ran, the two wreck havoc on the neighboring residents 
      of the forest and the humans that live near them.</p>
