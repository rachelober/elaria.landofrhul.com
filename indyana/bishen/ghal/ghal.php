    <p>However Ghal's egg traveled all the way to Degnuld swamps isbeyond anyone's 
      imagination, and even more beyond is how the egg fell into a small Atash 
      Bin Nidel's grubby paws who wants to make dinner out of him! Ghal decides 
      to break free of his egg and away from the stupid creatures </p>
    <p>Annoyed, the wyrm, tries to wriggle away but changes his mind when the 
      cold weather drives him back into the burrow. He decides to take the name 
      &quot;Ghal'pia'ran&quot; after what Misfortunate called him whenever he 
      hatched.</p>
    <p>Misfortunte is not the model caretaker and Ghal spends most of his life 
      scrounging around being a delinquant and not doing much training at all.</p>
    <p>One day he meets a <a href="../eidea/eideacol.php">fiery 
      female</a> who is surprised to see another Hirgyae in Rhul and even more 
      surprised to see one of high standing (having 4 wings/ 4 back legs). When 
      she realizes how weak he is, she is disgusted (and disappointed).</p>
    <p>This gives him the ambition to find a powerful magic user and trainer that 
      would build up his abilities to defeat the greatest foes (especially that 
      snippy female).</p>
