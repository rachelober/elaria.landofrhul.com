      <h1>Talking Plants</h1>
      <p>It was easy for Moschata to see that Cucurbita loved plants... well duh 
        she was created *to* love plants!</p>
      <p>It was also a comfort to him to share what he loved most with someone 
        else. He did have issues about being the nicest he could be when people 
        did stupid things, however.</p>
      <p>*See, you need to spread the plants a part more, otherwise they will 
        not get enough sunlight. They also won't fight over the water as much.*</p>
      <p>&quot;Ah, I see... that is better information.&quot;</p>
      <p>Moschata had helped Cucurbita tidy up the patch quite easily. With a 
        swift growl or kick with his feet, the plants would recoil into a neat 
        position.</p>
      <p>Cucurbita was quite amazed at how well things were shaping up.</p>
      <p>*You may want to look into a better way of watering your plants. I can't 
        see how you can water this entire field in one day...*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita shrugged, she didn't know either, and in fact, never really 
        thought about it either. Maybe it was just one of the perks about being 
        a sprite.</p>
