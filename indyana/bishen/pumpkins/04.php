      <h1>The Mystery of Growing Plants</h1>
      <p>&quot;How'd you know that?&quot; Cucurbita asked <a href="moschata.php">Moschata</a>.</p>
      <p>*Hmm... you mean, predict the rain?*</p>
      <p>She nodded as she gazed down at the little cup she had fashioned out 
        of wood and filled with warm cider. It was now pouring quite hard and 
        she and Moschata had escaped to her home. It was a very tight squeeze 
        but they managed to fit inside. She motioned silently to a second cup 
        but Moschata declined.</p>
      <p>*No, no thank you. Really, I wouldn't know how to drink it.* he laughed. 
        Cucurbita kept gazing downward. *Ahck, don't look so glum.*</p>
      <p>&quot;How'd you know...?&quot; she lifted her head and raised and eyebrow.</p>
      <p>Moschata sighed, *I'm magical, of course*.</p>
      <p>&quot;I'd really appreciate a truthful answer... please&quot;.</p>
      <p>*No, really. I really quite am.*</p>
      <p>&quot;It's very rare that a dragon would be in this part of Rhul... if 
        at all.&quot;</p>
      <p>*Oh, I know. I have been wandering in this land for a little while now. 
        Probably a few months I am guessing. It is a little hard for me to tell 
        how long because your daylight comes from a different direction and your 
        seasons are a little... off.*</p>
      <p>&quot;Off?&quot;</p>
      <p>*Hmm... yes I would term it... &quot;off&quot;. You know, not quite what 
        I am use to. I was transported here from a different land, we had much 
        more moderate temperatures there. Here, I am in fear that my poor leaves 
        may turn gold and fall off if I stay here much longer!*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita giggled slightly to his antics but calmed quickly. &quot;Oh, 
        don't worry I am sure they would grow back!&quot;</p>
      <p>He huffed, *I am not as sure, I believe I heard a story once that another 
        Bishel of my genes was in a great frost and her leaves froze and cracked 
        off completely! She was nothing but a plan green Bish after that!*</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh, poor her!&quot;</p>
      <p>*Eh, she had more things to worry about, first how to get out of that 
        frozen ice block she was living in!*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita really giggled loudly as she chatted with Moschata, but still, 
        he avoided the topic about his prediction about the rain. &quot;Please, 
        sir, tell me... how is it that you knew about the rain? The sky was perfectly 
        clear with just few clouds.&quot;</p>
      <p>Moschata rolled his eyes slightly, *Really now, is it that important?*</p>
      <p>&quot;I must know, truly...&quot; she leaned closer to the dragon, making 
        him feel a little more uncomfortable in the tight squeeze he was already 
        in.</p>
      <p>*Eh, fine fine, I will tell you just please give me a little more room!* 
        Cucurbita leaned back attentively. *Since you are a magical being, I believe 
        I can trust you with this information.*</p>
      <p>&quot;Oh really, you shall!&quot;</p>
      <p>*And of course, since you are very much a non-social being...*</p>
      <p>&quot;That's just rude, sir&quot;</p>
      <p>*Fine, fine. As I was saying, you are a creature that too tends to the 
        plants. In reality, I have been blessed with a gift of communicating with 
        plants.*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita's moth dropped open. &quot;Really?&quot;</p>
      <p>*No, I entertain at parties to awe small children... gah of course it 
        is true! I wouldn't waste so much time not telling you before if it wasn't!*</p>
      <p>&quot;Well now, sir I have invited you into my home, I expect to have 
        a little more respect,&quot; she sighed.</p>
      <p>*And ma'am, if I may deduce, you allow me to walk all over your naivety, 
        therefore it is within my boundaries to make any comment I wish.*</p>
      <p>She pouted a bit, &quot;I am not young you know,&quot;</p>
      <p>*But you most definitely act it. You may be old but what you've seen 
        is all limited to the worn fence around your pumpkin patch. I am probably 
        younger in years than you are, but have seen more wars than you could 
        ever conceive!*</p>
      <p>He had her beat, of course she had never seen a war. That wasn't in her 
        job description... at least she assumed so.</p>
      <p>*Exactly, young one. Although your art skillful, you have yet mastered 
        much that goes into life. Only until then will you be able to understand 
        my power with plants.*</p>
      <p>&quot;So you talk to the plants? Did they tell you of the rain?&quot;</p>
      <p>*They are very in tune with the weather... they need to be in order to 
        survive. Somehow many of us have lost the ability to communicate with 
        our worlds and instead hide under the notion that we have never know and 
        indeed will never knowhow to unlock this ability.*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita didn't speak for a little while after that statement. &quot;You 
        make me wonder my placeon this earth.&quot;</p>
      <p>*Good.*</p>
      <p>&quot;I don't think of this as a good feeling, at least, not really.&quot;</p>
      <p>*I don't think it is suppose to be a good feeling.*</p>
      <p>&quot;But why live then? Why can't we just shut our feelings off and 
        move from day to day, doing our duties and still moving the world around?&quot;</p>
      <p>*I can't answer these for you, Cucurbita, but I think I can help you 
        learn more about the plants you care for.*</p>
