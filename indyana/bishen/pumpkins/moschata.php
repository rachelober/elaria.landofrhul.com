      <p> This middle-aged male is calm and usually helpful. He is not extremely 
        friendly, but he will be polite to those he encounters. He tends to keep 
        to himself and enjoys collecting interesting objects he finds on his long 
        walks in the forest.</p>
      <p>He likes teaching those interested in nature all about the plants that 
        are close to him. He loves his gift and isn't afraid to flaunt it, although 
        he is usually decent about it. He stays with Cucurbita until she is ready 
        to go into hibernation but then begins to wander again.</p>
      <p>He has never had a true bondmate and in reality, doesn't want one. He 
        did wish to meet a female one day and have children but the opportunity 
        never came up until one day a lovely <a href="../pyyon/pyyon.php">female 
        bishen</a> with the same affinity for plants glided into his world. She 
        caught his eye with her delicate words and care for her Magical Object- 
        the Branch of Plenty, which could produce enough food for hundreds of 
        starving people.</p>
      <p>He admires her desire to help others and tries his best to teach her 
        about the plants she creates and gives her strength in finding ways to 
        accomplish her want. During this time, he fell in love with this younger 
        Bishen and decided to confess his love by giving her a beautiful head 
        wreath made of pumpkin vine with long flowing ribbons from the back.</p>

      <h2>Gifts</h2>
      <p>As a mating gift, Pyyon took the lantern Moschata found in the woods 
        back whenever they were falling in love and decorated it in wonderful 
        vines and little berries. She presented it to him as a token of her love.</p>
