      <h1>Hey You!</h1>
      <p>Cucurbita awoke to a large snout pressed close to her cheek. GASP, she 
        sputtered. &quot;Oh my god, don't eat me!!&quot; she screamed only as 
        a sprite could do and attempted to wiggle from the monster. A snort puffed 
        from the nostrils of the beast as if it were laughing.</p>
      <p>*You have but little meat on you, young one,* a voice spoke calmly.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="stages/mc81m.gif" width="215" height="310" /></p>
      <p>Cucurbita opened her right eye in a slit. She pulled her arms from their 
        defensive position and opened her other eye. Standing before her was a 
        leaf-green dragon form. It was only about the size of a large dog, but 
        to a sprite he was quite huge.</p>
      <p>*C'mon now, I have already determined you as no threat. With that, I 
        am no threat to you.*</p>
      <p>&quot;What?&quot; Cucurbita replied, where had the voice come from. She 
        swilved her head looking around her and noticed that the sun had began 
        to peak its corners along the horizon. &quot;Oh no... oh no oh no! How 
        long have I been asleep??&quot; She immediately sprung up like a new vine 
        from the soil and scurried along looking for her watering can. &quot;How 
        could I let this happen...&quot; she puttered away, seemingly forgetting 
        the &quot;horrible beast&quot; that followed her around.</p>
      <p>*You are quite the interesting creature, you know? Especially for a sprite. 
        Most have had the common decency of introducing themselves.*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita continued without even looking up. She wimpered a little as 
        she realized she would not have nearly enough water to finish the last 
        two rows of the patch.</p>
      <p>Having just about enough, the dragon wrapped his vine-like tail around 
        the sprite, *For such a silly little fairy, you sure are persistant in 
        what you do!*</p>
      <p>&quot;Ugh! Stop! Really now! I -REALLY- can't talk to you right now!&quot; 
        she grunted and tried to wiggle her way out of his grasp.</p>
      <p>*What? Are you daunted by my ability to communicate to you through telepathy?*</p>
      <p>&quot;Of course not...&quot;</p>
      <p>*For a sprite, being around magical creatures all the time, should be 
        quite use to this.*</p>
      <p>*wriggle* &quot;Actually, I am not, I live by myself... totally&quot;.</p>
      <p>The dragon dropped the sprite on the ground. *Ah, so that is why. You're 
        just anti-social, or don't even know the first thing about how to talk 
        to others.*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita just turned her back to the dragon and tended to the vines 
        once again.</p>
      <p>*Hey... you! I am com-u-ni-ca-ting -with- -you-!*</p>
      <p>&quot;Yes...&quot; she muttered, &quot;and I choose...&quot; her voice 
        diminishes after that.</p>
      <p>*Choose? And choose what? And you choose what? Out with it now!*</p>
      <p>She wiped around quickly to face the snout of the dragon, &quot;I choose 
        not to reply to your comments. You've put me too far behind my duties.&quot; 
        She fliped her body around quickly again and acted as if the dragon didn't 
        exist.</p>
      <p>The dragon paused and squinted his eyes at the sprite. *You know, they 
        talk about you...*</p>
      <p>Cucurbita paused and looked side to side. &quot;...who?&quot;</p>
      <p>*Oh no, I really don't have time to talk to you anymore I really must 
        be going.* he flipped his tail and leaves in front of Cucurbita's face 
        as he turned to leave. She watched as the perfect beauty of his tail and 
        leaves shone in the early light.</p>
      <p>&quot;You have really beautiful leaves,&quot; she commented solumnly 
        and turned around slowly, clutching the watering can close to her chest.</p>
      <p>The dragon looked back at the sprite. *Thank you,* he nodded, *Really, 
        they don't need to be watered today. It will rain without delay.* Within 
        moments a light rain began to fall on the two standing in the open patch.</p>
