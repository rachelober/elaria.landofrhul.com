    <p align="center"><img src="stages/hc04fd.gif" alt="Eidea'col" width="372" height="314" /></p>
    <p>Ever since her birth, Eidea'col has taken after Iniara and shown right 
      off who is in charge. While Iniara changes and grows into the life of a 
      Daemenite, Eidea'col takes offense to Iniara's seemingly <q>acceptance of 
      the norm</q>. Highly perceptive, Eidea'col absorbed Iniara's personality 
      as her own when she was still inside her egg, and although her name might 
      mean <q>fiery girl</q>, she exhibits the same protected trust that Iniara 
      held before falling on the shores of Demintrix.</p>
    <p> What Eidea'col enjoys most is when Iniara spends time with her hunting 
      small animals. Of course, as Eidea'col grows larger, the rabbits and squirrels 
      are not enough and humans become a better target. In Iniara's overwhelming 
      sorrow, the need to move from Litor takes Iniara and Eidea'col away from 
      the forest that they had grown accustomed to and leads them to the life 
      they were meant to have on the island of ice, alone with each other.</p>
    <p>She feels most alive after fighting a battle. She purposely goes out of 
      her way, flying through the lands of Rhul, looking for a foe to fight. She 
      trains this way and constantly looks for ways to improve her power. Her 
      biggest fear is the day when there is no one else to fight.</p>

    <h2>Powers/Attacks</h2>
    <p>(Unnammed) -- Eidea can grow to an enormous size to help her attack in 
      battle against large foes. Iniara thinks she may have learned this from 
      her encounter with Im'os and then practiced it on her own.</p>
    <p>(Unnammed) -- The spikes on Eidea's back grow fiery hot and grow larger 
      and sharper. When the spikes have grown large enough, they explode with 
      a burst of energy, lose their heat immediately and form thick ice crystals 
      all along the backside of her body which are very hard to break and act 
      as a defense mechanism as well as a weapon.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Gifts</h2>
    <p>At Christmas time at the Bishen Realm, when Eidea'col was still a wyrm, 
      she received two small gifts from Indyana as well as a stocking full of 
      candy.</p>
