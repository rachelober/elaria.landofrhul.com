    <h1>En Route</h1>
    <p>The caravan started early the next morning. Iniara, still half asleep and 
      dazed sat in the carriage behind the driver's seat. On the other hand, Ad'cero 
      seemed cheerful and bright.</p>
    <p><q>Iniara, dear,</q> Ad'cero politely addressed the mistress.</p>
    <p><q>Wha?</q> Iniara returned, not particularly paying attention nor caring, 
      as she stared out one of the carriage's windows.</p>
    <p><q>Um, congratulations on winning the egg,</q> Ad'cero spoke in a calm, 
      hopeful voice.</p>
    <p><q>The eeggg...</q> Iniara trailed off, <q>the... egg... egg... EGG?</q> 
      Iniara's eyes lit up at the pronunciation of the last word and quickly scanned 
      the area with her eyes and frantically moved her garments from placed to 
      place in search for the missing item.</p>
    <p>Perplexed, Ad'cero politely coughed and pointed to the small basket that 
      lay on the seat next to Iniara. <q>Really, Iniara, how much sleep did you 
      manage to receive last night? You are not your usual, perky self this morning,</q> 
      Ad'cero commented, slightly smirking at her latter remark.</p>
    <p> Iniara quickly calmed herself and attempted to straighten her posture 
      in her seat, <q>Oh, a FINE rest indeed!</q></p>
    <p>When the caravan arrived back to Crykst through the portal, they prepared 
      their vessels for departure across the straight back to the mainland of 
      Rhul.</p>
    <p><q>I don't particularly care for this weather, Iniara,</q> Im'os struggled 
      to squeak as the winds of the island raced past his body, nearly knocking 
      him over.</p>
    <p>The skies were gray even though, to Iniara's knowledge, it was almost midday. 
      <q>I think we will be fine,</q> she replied, gazing to the sky and mentally 
      challenging any storm that would attempt to best her.</p>
    <p>She held Eidea'col close to her as she boarded the makeshift vessel with 
      Ad'cero and Im'os. The currents ran swift that day and worried Ad'cero as 
      much as it did earlier to Im'os.</p>
    <p><q>You know what they say about stormy days, eh, Iniara?</q> Im'os attempted 
      to nudge Iniara in her seat. <q>Well, don't you?</q> She pretended to ignore 
      him and stared down at the dark blue egg that sat in her lap. <q>Hrm,</q> 
      he grunted and forlornly bent his head.</p>
    <p><q>What do they say about stormy days, Im'os?</q> Ad'cero politely questioned 
      and leaned forward in her seat across from Im'os to hear well.</p>
    <p>The old imp produced a wistful smile, <q>Oh, in ancient folklore, sea storms 
      symbolize a test of some sort. Err, yes, like the defeat of a great monster 
      or simply overcoming a seasonal drought I suppose...</q></p>
    <p>Ad'cero laughed, <q>Yes, storms usually help the droughts...</q></p>
    <p>Im'os blushed slightly, <q>Besides that, the folklore predicts these challenges 
      after a long storm. And if the person's test is successfully completed, 
      they will be rewarded. Such that, well, you know how sometimes large waves 
      carry small fish to the land after the storm? Well, the fish symbolize prosperity 
      in the coming days.</q></p>
    <p><q>Ah,</q> Ad'cero nodded. As a child, she recalled, she sometimes traveled 
      south of the Mardesos Cove with her father, a skilled fisherman. On some 
      mornings, she bathed in the sand by the cove and watched the waves roll 
      in. Other mornings, after a storm, she could see many little fish washed 
      up on the shore, some still flapping in the sand, struggling to return to 
      the safety of the sea.</p>
    <p>Of course, her father would instruct her to gather the fish to sell. Now 
      she would wonder about the great fortune in finding the fish those mornings, 
      but realize that something still had to suffer for that prosperity...</p>
    <p>Iniara chose to listen to Im'os' story after all, <q>Im'os, you understand 
      folklore is not anything but children stories!</q></p>
    <p>Pausing for a moment after a breath of air, Im'os replied, <q>From what 
      I remember, a certain empress used to enjoy hearing such &#8216;children 
      stories'!</q></p>
    <p>Taken aback, Iniara flushed a strange shade of blue at her cheeks. <q>Are 
      you calling me a... a... child?!</q></p>
    <p><q>No, no. Of course not,</q> Im'os mockingly expressed, obviously gaining 
      some momentum in the conversation, <q>If you had ever been a child at all, 
      it sure slipped my recollection!</q></p>
    <p>Outraged, Iniara made a movement to stand in the makeshift vessel when 
      a large crack came from the exterior of the ship.</p>
    <p><q>M'lady!</q> a crewmember shouted from outside the cabin door, <q>We 
      near the land and the boat scraped across a laden rock!</q></p>
    <p>A ruckus emitted from the boat and continued to sway in the heavy winds, 
      as the storm grew insinuatingly worse.</p>
    <p><q>By Aille!</q> Iniara screamed as she lunged forward in the cabin and 
      gracefully knocked the back of her head on the doorway when attempting to 
      compensate for her fall. With a groan, she rolled over on the small floor 
      and passed out.</p>
    <p>The boat continued to drift southwestward, slowly filling with water, and 
      rocking without containment. Many crewmembers flung from the edge of the 
      boat and met their end in the shadowy waters below.</p>
    <p>Ad'cero and Im'os could see through the blistering rain and made out the 
      sight of land near off to the direct south.</p>
    <p><q>Im'os!</q> Ad'cero yelled as she exited the cabin to the other fleeing 
      members of the crew, <q>Grab Iniara, make sure we still have the egg and 
      grab only what is necessary!</q></p>
    <p>The rain beat down hard on the boat's deck. Ad'cero continued to cross 
      the exterior in order to reach one of the makeshift lifeboats that hung 
      from the side. The boat shook and Ad'cero fell to her knees. She gripped 
      at the loose planks of the boat and finished the way to the side by crawling. 
      In the meantime, Im'os gathered Iniara's staff and placed the egg in one 
      of Iniara's pockets. He gazed down at the woman and quickly remembered the 
      first time he saw her.</p>
    <p><q>Just like before, all alone and unaware...</q> he whispered. The seemingly 
      old and feeble imp bent his knees, extended his arms underneath Iniara's 
      back and lifted up. <q>Urrggh,</q> he grunted, <q>but this time a lot heavier!</q> 
      and escaped through the doorway of the cabin.</p>
    <p><q>Over here, quick!</q> Ad'cero had the boat prepared. She wearily watched 
      a wave crash against the side of the weakening sides of the boat. <q>Throw 
      her inside here and let's depart quickly Im'os!</q></p>
    <p>The imp gathered his strength and quickly leaped across the boards to the 
      raft. Leaning over the side, he calmly put Iniara into the boat and hopped 
      in himself. Ad'cero quickly discharged the raft and the two paddled away 
      from the boat.</p>
    <p>When the waters became slightly calmer, Ad'cero commented, <q>I am not 
      even going to question how you jumped around on that moving boat so skillfully 
      back there,</q> she coyly smiled. In turn, Im'os flushed a bit and did not 
      respond.</p>
    <p>The calming sensation lasted but a moment when a large wave shadowed the 
      interior of the raft. <q>Im'os! That wave will topple the boat!</q> was 
      all Ad'cero exasperated before the wave dropped over their heads.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><q>Ugh...</q> Iniara groaned as she heard the singing songs of birds over 
      her head. It was much more moderate and she could feel the sun on the back 
      of her neck since her face had been firmly planted into the sand. <q>Where... 
      where am I?</q> she questioned as she moved her arms, stiff and sore, to 
      lift her head from the ground, but found it much too demanding. Instead, 
      she somehow managed to flip her body over and lay on the sand with a warm 
      sun overhead. Her eyes closed.</p>
    <p><q>Mother... I think, I think she is waking up,</q> a male voice whispered 
      over Iniara's head. <q>Come over here, I don't know what to do.</q></p>
    <p>Iniara heard a few slow steps limp across the floor and make their way 
      to her side.</p>
    <p><q>Ah... more color in her face, I see. Yes, son, she will be alright.</q> 
      Iniara was still sore. She could feel her muscles tense as the woman walked 
      closer to the bed and lay a hand on her forehead. <q>It is so strange to 
      see this woman, especially since she isn't a part of our tribe, Derik.</q></p>
    <p><q>I know, mother. I really don't know where she came from. My only conclusion 
      was that she was on a boat and it must have tipped over in that storm a 
      day or so ago. Lucky for her, I passed by the shore last night and found 
      her! If she would have stayed out there all cold and wet overnight, who 
      knows if she would have survived...</q></p>
    <p>Iniara cracked her eyes open slightly. To her amazement, she saw a young 
      man with teal colored skin and dark red hair sitting off to her right, facing 
      an older woman, also teal in skin tone with silvery hair. What... where 
      am and who are these people? She thought and rested her eyes shut again 
      and sighed loudly, unfortunately without realizing that it would signal 
      the young man's attention.</p>
    <p><q>Mother! She does awaken! Oh, by Aille she'll be fine!</q></p>
    <p><q>Oh what have a gotten myself into now...?</q> She silently spoke in 
      her head. She deduced that she might as well stop pretending to be unconscious 
      and weakly opened her eyes again. The man, named Derik, sat prepared next 
      to her and hung his head over hers and as she opened her eyes, she was startled 
      by his appearance and twitched in the bed she lay in.</p>
    <p><q>Oh! My, I'm sorry... Miss?</q> Derik's eyes were a cool blue and reflected 
      the light from a nearby candle at the bedside and he sympathetically gazed 
      down at Iniara. Not a speck of inconsistency of his skin tone, his face 
      looked soft and kind. His body, like Iniara's, was thin but strong like 
      iron. She estimated that he was about his height, which was new to her since 
      she had never met anyone that stood her size.</p>
    <p><q>I... I...</q> she spoke softly while staring in his eyes and tried to 
      lift her torso, only to fall back from her weakness.</p>
    <p><q>M'lady, please remain reclined. You've been through a lot. Last night 
      I found you on Bradshaw's all torn up and soaked! I carried you back to 
      my house and my mother, Merold, and I, Derik,</q> he smiled a bit mentioning 
      his name, <q>cleaned you up and nursed you.</q> He sounded eager to tell 
      Iniara everything about her ordeal. <q>Oh, my,</q> he paused, <q>now that 
      you are awake, tell us your name and about yourself! We have to know where 
      you came from.</q></p>
    <p><q>Shush, Derik, let her be!</q> Merold hissed, <q>Please don't mind my, 
      silly, son.</q> She attempted to smile slightly through her wrinkled cheeks.</p>
    <p>Iniara lay motionless but gave a wistful stare to the couple. <q>My name... 
      is Iniara.</q></p>
    <p><q>Iniara?</q> Derik questioned. <q>Wait...</q></p>
    <p><q>No, no you must be delirious, dear?</q> Merold whispered and leaned 
      closer to her bedside.</p>
    <p><q>Heh,</q> Derik laughed, <q>If your name was that, you've risen from 
      the dead.</q> He patted Iniara's leg, <q>But I'll call you Nara, for short,</q> 
      it seemed that he wanted to be cute with the empress.</p>
    <p>She sighed silently to herself and closed her eyes again.</p>
