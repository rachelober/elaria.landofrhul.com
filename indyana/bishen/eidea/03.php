    <h1>Storyteller</h1>
    <p>The day broke anew on Litor as Iniara rose from her chambers and took reign 
      over her seat once again, as she did every morning. Cool torches stood silent 
      next to her throne, enchanted by the essence of a frozen flame. Today she 
      would council travelers that had mistakenly fallen into her domain.</p>
    <p><q>Who is the first visitor, Im'os?</q> Iniara called to her chief advisor.</p>
    <p>A small imp arrived at the Empress' feet. He slumped over with a curved 
      back and raised a voice that could be comparative to creaking floors. <q>A 
      woman from Hearth, Empress.</q> The old man stepped up onto the panel and 
      unwrapped a bounded scroll, <q>Announcing, your visitor, Ad'cero Wordanvor! 
      Today she will discuss the boundaries of Rhul and mystic forces that have 
      broken these boundaries.</q></p>
    <a href="http://mumsy.misplaced-sanity.net/"><img src="images/adcero.gif" alt="Ad'cero" width="70" height="150" border="0" align="left" /></a> 
    <p>A few guards usher forth an old woman covered in shawls in a myriad of 
      colors and fur types. Ad'cero bows in front of the mistress as she speaks 
      in a deep voice, <q>Good morning, Empress Iniara. I come from the north 
      with much news that you will love to learn about.</q></p>
    <p>Iniara smiled slightly, almost deviously, <q>Please, Ad'cero, dear, tell 
      me what I would like to know.</q></p>
    <p>Ad'cero winced slightly, <q>I would love to, your highness, but my bones 
      are old and if you want to hear the end, prepare my body to be able to reach 
      that far.</q></p>
    <p>With a groan, the ice empress rolled her eyes and motioned for a guard, 
      <q>Bring the old maid a chair, make it nice for her to sit in for however 
      long that may be.</q> After a tedious task of finding a decent chair, after 
      chair, after chair for the maid, Iniara exploded unrepentantly on the twenty-second 
      attempt. She rose from her throne and towered over Ad'cero, <q>Why must 
      I be surrounded by incompetence!</q> She motioned quickly to her staff, 
      which channeled her inner glare, and held it pressed to the middle of her 
      forehead.</p>
    <p><q>I would pursue this no further, for I am sure that if you would fulfill 
      your desire to eliminate me, you will never know of the Hirgyae Clan.</q></p>
    <p>Iniara slowly dropped the staff a few inches, <q>And why this Hirgyae Clan?</q></p>
    <p><q>Once a year, a representative of this clan brings to the Bishen Realm 
      a handful of their strongest eggs to adopt to other realms. This species 
      of dragon withholds deep elemental powers inside their body and allows for 
      a powerful mage, such as you, to unlock these innate abilities by training 
      them to adhere to their destiny.</q></p>
    <p>A small smile crept to the edges of the ice queen's lips, </q>Perfect, 
      Ad'cero. Now where shall I find this <q>Bishen Realm?</q></q></p>
    <p><q>A portal exists between the forest of the Bishen and Rhul only through 
      the waterways of the North, I am afraid it exhibits a daring journey for 
      even the most experienced adventurers.</q></p>
    <p><q>No matter,</q> Iniara waved the maid off, <q>for I have never backed 
      down from a challenge yet. Im'os, prepare my Kujiin carriage and order my 
      chambermaids to arrange my belongings for travel. This time tomorrow we 
      will set out of Litor, through Arube and hopefully make it north of Hearth 
      by sunset the following day. There we shall rest and continue the trip across 
      the Sadlan River to the nearest port on Nirka's Isthmus.</q> With that, 
      Iniara walked back to her throne. /q>Place Ad'cero in a bedroom, she will 
      travel along with us and will be responsible for directions to this <q>Bishen 
      Realm</q>.</q> Iniara then turned to the haggard old woman, <q>And let me 
      direct this to you Ad'cero personally, if what you say is in truth, you 
      will be rewarded. However, if I have found you in a lie, you will find yourself 
      locked in a tower of ice just as any of the figures that display before 
      you.</q></p>
