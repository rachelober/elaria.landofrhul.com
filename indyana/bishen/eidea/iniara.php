    <p> Iniara is a witch to put in plain terms. She believes that she is one 
      of a kind and a blessing of the gods upon the Land of Rhul. Of course, these 
      thoughts melt away whenever she finds herself lost in Demintrix and especially 
      when she finds Derik. Just then, she realizes that she is indeed a part 
      of the tribe of Daemenites, but was lost more than half a century ago. She 
      comes to accept her ancestry and the predictions tied into her birth underneath 
      the full moon.</p>

    <h2>Attacks</h2>
    <p><b>S'dia d' Woia (Controlling of Mind)</b>: a strong ability to control 
      the body movements and behavior of someone nearby. In the story, she uses 
      this power to make the bartender in Hearth to slowly become intoxicated 
      while talking to Ad'cero. She also uses a form of this to calm Eidea'col 
      when she is first born and starts to tear Merold's house apart.</p>
    <p><b>Emah Chitice (Ice Heart)</b>: Iniara has full control of turning anything 
      frozen. This includes bodies where she can control the temperature to slowly 
      fall and soon stop someone's heart, i.e. how the attack got its name.</p>
