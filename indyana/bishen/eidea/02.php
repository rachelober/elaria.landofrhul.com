    <h1>Growth</h1>
    <p>Iniara grew quickly over the seasons. By her twelfth season, she had mastered 
      her telepathy and freezing capabilities. Thus began her rule over Litor. 
      Once described as having <q>an insatiable appetite for her own acceptance</q>, 
      Iniara developed her own code for her magic and converted those <q>lost</q> 
      to its powers. Her thirtieth season proved to be her most successful as 
      she published her great works concerning Bepth&ouml;r and when she developed 
      the council.</p>
    <p>An old fable of this time alludes to her own advisors as people she constructed 
      out of clay by the stream's current and enchanted by her icy breath. Her 
      cold hearth thereby covered by her many layers of furs left her followers 
      ignorant to her self-centered ways. Iniara never stopped her craving for 
      learning, whenever she heard of a language she never had spoken; she immediately 
      demanded her advisors to seek out a teacher so that she may learn the tongue.</p>
    <p>Although full of self-interests, Iniara gave shelter to many creatures 
      of Litor in her ice. By this time of her forty-second season she began to 
      capture the life of the plants in the everlasting gaze under the crystals 
      of ice to forever incase their picture.</p>
    <p>All but one plant life she left grow. The first tree she awoke to remain 
      untouched by the icy glare and grew to form a canopy over the entire ice 
      forest. Her domain stretched from the most southern tip of Rhul where the 
      Phem Rvves pass crossed to the Arube forest. Her popularity grew among her 
      minions and her intelligence rose from outstanding to unimaginable. But 
      still, her thirst thickened.</p>
    <p>The magwood tree lie in the middle of her domain and underneath sat a solid 
      chair of ice where Iniara sat day after day overlooking her subjects, designing 
      the Council of Bepth&ouml;r and strengthening her undying army. She grew 
      in height as well as her domination over the smaller gnomes and dryads of 
      the forest and puny rodents she became accustomed to.</p>
    <p>Day by day, her advisors were instructed to find storytellers to spread 
      knowledge of Rhul to her so that she may learn of the other lands without 
      actually moving from her chains of ice. This way, she might accomplish all 
      that she ever wanted and all she wished to know.</p>
