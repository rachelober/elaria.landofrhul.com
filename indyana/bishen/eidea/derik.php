    <h1>Derik</h1>
    <p>Derik is an interesting man. He is still quite young in the sense of a 
      Daemenite and acts like it too. He finds Iniara on a beach one day and immediately 
      recognizes her as an important person (her clothes give it away). He brings 
      her back to his home where he lives with his mother to bring Iniara back 
      to health.</p>
    <p>Whenever she wakes up, she tells him her name and immediately he is reminded 
      of a tale of a baby that was stolen by that same name. He tells her to go 
      by the name of Nara while in Demintrix so that others would not catch on 
      that this <q>visitor</q> from another clan was the fulfiller of the prophecy.</p>
    <p>Throughout this time, Derik believes that Nara is a gift to him and naively 
      thinks she will feel the same about him and that they will have a wonderful 
      life.</p>
    <p>He tricks her into marrying him in an ancient Daemenite marriage ceremony 
      and tells her that they are bonded forever now. When all hell breaks lose 
      in Demintrix later that night, she flees with Eidea'col and Ad'cero but 
      left Derik behind. Compelled because of his bond to Iniara, he follows them 
      all the way back to Litor.</p>
