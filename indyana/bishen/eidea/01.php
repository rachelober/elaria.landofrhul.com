    <h1>Birthright</h1>
    <p>Along the outer reaches of Rhul, the forest of Litor, once blooming with 
      lush plants and growth, has been enchanted by magic. The outcasts of the 
      land gather on these outer reaches and follow the ways of the Daemen in 
      order to fulfill their capabilities. The Daemen, the pure essence of magic 
      in Rhul, leads the true and wicked, the fearful and sympathetic to unimaginable 
      depths. Ownership over this essence leaves the powerful urging more control 
      in a fight for dominance and the secure desperate to lock it away for times 
      of better need.</p>
    <p>This is where Iniara (in-i-ra) falls between the categories. As a young 
      child of no particular ancestry, even depicted as androgynous, founded the 
      Council of Bepth&ouml;r (behp-tahr) under the fellowship of a dark magic. 
      Dark magic closely translated to personal freedom and management of affairs 
      without consideration of other people. Loneliness of a child permeates experimentation, 
      and for Iniara, a name she had given herself, this drove her into the darker 
      sides of the Daemen.</p>
    <p><a href="http://apitchou.free.fr/"><img src="images/iniara.gif" alt="Iniara" width="46" height="112" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="0" align="left" /></a>She, 
      to classify the being as mostly feminine, awoke one morn lost in the depths 
      of Litor. Her glossy silver hair covered her eyes, while she tried desperately 
      to see where she was. The young child knew nothing of a past and nothing 
      of a future. She sat awake underneath a tall magwood tree, known for their 
      height and long life span, for days on end, attempting to remember a mother 
      or a father or any understanding of who she was. These days and nights passed 
      with little luck, therefore Iniara came to the conclusion that she had just 
      been born out of a mystical force.</p>
    <p>Many who have come to know her describe her eyes as piercing as glass, 
      or as she sometimes enjoyed categorizing this feeling as <q>stabbing icicles</q>. 
      Determined, even from <q>birth</q>, Iniara searched among the plants, weeds 
      and growth for clues to her arrival. This determination and almost self-centered 
      disposition has given her the name <q>Ice Empress</q>, among other key aspects 
      of the forest that came later along in life. If she were to be compared 
      to any other living creature in Rhul, she carried the thin agile body of 
      a Daemenite including their color of skin, even though hers stood out as 
      more of a sheer blue, and fetish for magic.</p>
    <p>Living in Litor had its advantages of course, in contrast the Daemenites 
      were persecuted in Emblem for using magic and the Daemen, but in the depths 
      of Litor, Iniara could practice dark magic to her own pleasing. On the discovery 
      of this innate power of hers, Iniara used it in her own best interest, thus 
      determining it <q>Dark</q> magic.</p>
    <p>It was a cool afternoon when Iniara discovered a small pebble that lie 
      near a thin stream that ran past her original <q>birth</q> place. The pebble 
      reflected the sunlight, or in actuality lack of, into her dark eyes in unusual 
      patterns. There she visualized the complexity of crystals and felt the enchanting 
      call of the magic within her. Holding out her hand, palm directly above 
      the fractures stone, she willed the pebble to rise to her fingertips. At 
      her will, the object moved and she turned her gasp to her eyes and believed. 
      A breath of cool air escaped her lungs as it passed from her lips to the 
      shiny object of her attraction.</p>
    <p>A thin layer of condensation had remained on the pebble from its time by 
      the stream and the breath of air froze it close to the stone. Layer upon 
      layer of ice grew from her breath until it was almost too cold to her touch. 
      The new object hardened and at her pleasing, she withdrew her hand and levitated 
      the ice encased rock just a few inches from her fingertips before she lost 
      her mental grip and the stone crashed into the hardened ground, fragmenting 
      into millions of glittering, iced stone.</p>
    <p>A wicked smile approached the corners of her ears as her officially awakening 
      shaped her into a formidable opponent. Her birthright, the magic as she 
      came to find as the Council of Bepth&ouml;r shaped her motives and her dreams 
      into the solitary confinement of the ice.</p>
