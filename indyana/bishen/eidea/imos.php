    <h1>Im'os</h1>
    <p>Not much is known about Im'os. Even Iniara doesn't know much about her 
      trusted servant, even though apparently he knows much about her and has 
      been next to her since her &quot;birth&quot;.</p>
    <p> He seems like a shy beggar type of person, but whenever Ad'cero and he 
      crash on Demintrix's shore, we start to learn more about his ulterior motives...</p>
