    <h1>Festival of the Full Moon</h1>
    <p>Ad'cero quickly rolled Im'os over. <q>Im'os, you blundering fool! How could 
      you have been so careless... where is Iniara? Damn the currents. Blast...</q></p>
    <p>She had given up hope for a while and decided to sit back down and wait 
      in silence. She wasn't exactly sure where she and Im'os ended up but estimated 
      from the setting sun and the water's edge that they had drifted southwest 
      of their original course. She knew Eldora was directly south of Crykst but 
      the land wasn't hilly, let alone rocky. She sighed. This was not the way 
      she wanted to fulfill her elder years, especially with an old imp, unconscious 
      at her feet.</p>
    <p><q>What a lousy vacation,</q> she snuffed. Off to her right she saw a glittering 
      piece of stone. <q>Huh?</q> She lifted her tired, old body and walked closer. 
      There lay Iniara's blue power gem. <q>Now, what do we have here?</q> She 
      bent down and picked it up. <q>I guess she didn't float too long away from 
      here, I wonder if she is alive,</q> she pondered.</p>
    <p><q>Ugh... Get the twenty elephants off my chest!</q> Im'os growled as he 
      woke up.</p>
    <p>Ad'cero sighed, <q>Im'os, there are no elephants within a few hundred miles, 
      and I am sure the last place they would want to sit is on your chest!</q></p>
    <p><q>No need to be rude, old woman!</q> he snapped bitterly.</p>
    <p><q>I can be as rude as I want! You owe me that much after pulling me from 
      my home and taking me on this forsaken quest for a stupid egg! Now where 
      has it gotten us? Hmm?</q></p>
    <p>Im'os didn't catch her last comment and instead interrupted, <q>Where are 
      we?</q></p>
    <p><q>How would I know? Do I look like I am your personal map?</q></p>
    <p><q>Now that's a silly question, you don't look anything like a map,</q> 
      he sarcastically replied as he rubbed his sore head.</p>
    <p><q>Humph!</q></p>
    <p><q>Now seriously, Ad'cero, where are we? Do you have any idea, any clue... 
      at all?</q></p>
    <p><q>I think we drifted west of the Eldora Mountains, to be exact. We are 
      probably just a bit north of Emblem.</q> Im'os audibly gulped. <q>What's 
      for that scared look, Im'os?</q></p>
    <p><q>Oh, oh nothing.</q></p>
    <p><q>You are hiding something from me, aren't you!</q> she demanded.</p>
    <p><q>If I was?</q> he growled back in his raspy imp voice.</p>
    <p><q>I would kill you, even if I had to do it with my fingernails!</q></p>
    <p><q>Now that wouldn't answer your question either! Ha!</q></p>
    <p><q>Ooh, you silly imp, I should 'a stepped on you when I had the chance 
      in the forest before your thugs captured me!</q></p>
    <p><q>I would have liked to see you try, oldie! Before you were born, I was 
      killing people in Demintrix! Hehehe, you think I am scared of a little old 
      Hearthian?</q></p>
    <p><q>That's Hearthan, and yes, you should be, you devil!</q></p>
    <p><q>Go on a catch me, you fool!</q> Im'os leaped on his short, thin legs 
      and bounded off down the shoreline. Ad'cero followed in a heat.</p>
    <p><q>Come back' ere you, you... mongrel!</q></p>
    <p>The two sped inland and met with a forest of tall bushes. Im'os stopped 
      suddenly and ushered Ad'cero, who was just steps behind him to stay quiet.</p>
    <p><q>What, let me kill you properly, imp!</q> Ad'cero hushed.</p>
    <p><q>Then you'll get yourself killed by Daemenite wizards!</q></p>
    <p><q>What?</q></p>
    <p><q>Shh!</q></p>
    <p>A few hidden voices lurked behind the wall of bushes and could hardly be 
      heard. One voice began to speak, <q>Hmm, yes we need to keep an eye out 
      for weird activity. My suspicion intensifies with the approaching Moon festival.</q></p>
    <p><q>You concern yourself with petty thoughts,</q> a second voice piped, 
      <q>Prophecies are not to be taken as truth.</q></p>
    <p><q>A prophecy is a warning, I tell you. And if it is one thing our ancestors 
      taught us it was, well it was <q>always follow a prophecy!</q></q></p>
    <p><q>Iniara died in that attack by the devil, she was not stolen, and I can 
      assure you that.</q></p>
    <p><q>Iniara?</q> Ad'cero whispered. Im'os slunk back behind Ad'cero.</p>
    <p><q>With what proof can you present to delay my misery?</q> the first voice 
      questioned.</p>
    <p><q>She hasn't returned yet, that's what! Most children in that battle died 
      anyway.</q></p>
    <p><q>You make it seem like it was a meaningless event in our history, Bruhu.</q></p>
    <p><q>Enough, enough you two,</q> a third, feminine, voice chimed. <q>Either 
      way, this festival is a happy time; let's try to make it that way, shall 
      we?</q></p>
    <p>The two other voices grunted in reply and a shuffle of leaves signaled 
      their departure.</p>
    <p><q>Now what do you think that was all about, Im'os? Im'os?</q> Ad'cero 
      looked around but could not find the little imp.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><q>Ow! You little, erg!</q> Merold exclaimed from the other room.</p>
    <p> <q>What was that?</q> Derik responded.</p>
    <p><q>Nara, your little delinquent of a dragon just bit me!</q> she walked 
      into the kitchen holding Eidea'col in front of her body. The little wyrm 
      writhed in the old woman's grip. Iniara grabbed Eidea'col and began to scold 
      her.</p>
    <p><q>Oh, Eidea'col! You should know better than to bite the hand that feeds 
      you!</q> and tapped the wyrm's nose. Not very pleased with her treatment, 
      Eidea'col snapped at Iniara's fingers and left tiny bite marks near the 
      joints. <q>OUCH!</q> Iniara yelled, dropping Eidea'col- but surprisingly, 
      the little wyrm went straight to flight and flew haphazardly to the top 
      of a cabinet.</p>
    <p><q>No! You little rascal, come back down here before you knock over one 
      of my vases!</q> Accompanied by what seemed like a laugh, Eidea'col used 
      her heavily armored tail to whip around on top of the cabinet and hit some 
      of the vases, which tumbled to the ground and broke in hundreds of pieces. 
      <q>GAH! Those were heirlooms!</q> Merold began to pull a chair close to 
      the cabinet and attempt to grab Eidea'col. <q>Damn you! I am going to KILL 
      YOU!</q></p>
    <p><q>No! Mother, NO!</q> Derik grabbed his mother and held her down, <q>Is 
      there no way you can dispel Eidea'col, Nara?</q></p>
    <p>She thought quickly, the leader of the Clan said nothing about calming 
      the wyrm once it hatched. <q>I... I... can't think of anything!</q> she 
      exasperated. The she remembered that she was a magician after all. <q>Everyone, 
      back away!</q> she pulled up her sleeves and readied her hands. She had 
      not performed magic recently without the aid of her channeling object, the 
      stone on top of her staff, which was most likely lost in the shipwreck.</p>
    <p>Closing her eyes, she began to whisper a calming spell then clasped her 
      hands together and extended her two index fingers and pointed them at Eidea'col. 
      <q>Nyan nehire shergun, Nyan nehire shergun... Nyan nehire shergun,</q> 
      she repeated. Eidea'col's eyes wearily drooped and her body became unsteady. 
      Soon, she lost control of her entire body and flopped from the cabinet to 
      the floor below. The force of her drop made a large cracking sound. <q>Oh, 
      Eidea'col!</q> Iniara whispered and rushed to the wyrm's side and checked 
      to see if she had broken anything. <q>Hum,</q> she inspected closer, <q>the 
      armor on her back must have protected her... nothing seems to be harmed, 
      except the china already on the ground.</q></p>
    <p><q>Let's tie her up, Nara!</q> Merold responded to the now sleeping wyrm.</p>
    <p><q>Isn't that a little... rash?</q> Derik commented.</p>
    <p><q>That... that... evil creature nearly ripped our limbs off and broke 
      our heirlooms! Derik, tell your friend that she cannot keep this wretch 
      in our house unless it is properly restrained!</q></p>
    <p>Derik sighed; he didn't want to see Iniara go. <q>Nara, I have to obey 
      my mother's wishes. Can you think of something we can do to restrain Eidea'col 
      before she wakes up? Then we can think of an appropriate way to handle Eidea'col.</q></p>
    <p>Iniara frowned, she already loved Eidea'col and grown attached to her, 
      even before her birth, but decided that it was best so that Eidea'col did 
      not hurt anyone until they were prepared to handle her. She nodded, <q>Okay, 
      maybe we can cover her mouth and hold her wings shut.</q></p>
    <p>The trio decided to wrap some cloth around her muzzle and do similar to 
      her wings so she couldn't fly.</p>
    <hr>
    <p><q>So, Iniara must be a lot more popular name than I thought,</q> Ad'cero 
      spoke singly. Im'os disappeared unexpectedly so she was alone for now. She 
      sighed, she still held Iniara's power gem in her hand and tucked it away 
      in her torn apron.</p>
    <p>She continued through the branches after she was confident that the Daemenite 
      wizards had left the area. The forest was quite quiet, which worried her. 
      The forests in Demintrix were much different then the Arube Forest she was 
      accustomed to. <q>Oh well,</q> she thought, <q>I might be old but I can 
      still navigate through any woodland.</q></p>
    <hr>
    <p><q>Derik, you have to help me!</q> Iniara pleaded. She followed Derik around 
      the kitchen area as he picked up the broken glass and vase pieces. He in 
      turn ignored her.</p>
    <p><q>I can't believe I am sacrificing my time for a dragon, one that isn't 
      even from Rhul, to boot!</q> he continued to mutter under his breath.</p>
    <p><q>Derik!</q> she implored once more and halted in the middle of the floor. 
      <q>Please, talk to me.</q></p>
    <p>Derik's eyes finally turned to the female, <q>What I have gotten myself 
      into from the day I found you.</q> He just shook his head with a sigh, <q>but 
      I have made a promise.</q></p>
    <p>He continued on, stopping once and a while to search the floor for forgotten 
      pieces. Iniara stalled but continued, <q>What promise?</q></p>
    <p>Derik's back was to Iniara but he sighed and responded, <q>I promised myself 
      that I would protect you.</q> He then continued to sweep the floor, content 
      that he had found all the fragments, however his mind drifted far from just 
      cleaning the kitchen's wooden floor.</p>
    <p><q>Why would you make such a senseless promise?</q> her mouth stalled open. 
      Her eyes followed the perimeter of his body, he seemed tired and weak.</p>
