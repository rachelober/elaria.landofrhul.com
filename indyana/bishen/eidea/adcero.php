    <p>Ad'cero is a strong willed woman who has been broken down by years of traveling. 
      After the loss of her daughter, she has spent her time traveling the lengths 
      of Rhul looking for the mythological creature who had stolen Jyina away 
      from her. Through discussion, she discovered that it was a Soarex who had 
      scared the kujiin which drove the wagon and then later picked up Jyina. 
      This brought her to the Northern Section of Rhul near Eldora. Through miscalculation 
      she crossed the straight between Demintrix and Crykst and fell on the island. 
      There she found the portal and visited the Bishen Realm, not having a need 
      to bond a dragon, she returned lost to Rhul and one day in the southern 
      sector of Hearth, was picked up by Im'os and Iniara's minions for trespassing. 
      She escaped being killed on the premise of teaching the Empress of the Northern 
      Sectors of Rhul, which is where we begin her story.</p>
