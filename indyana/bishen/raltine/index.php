    <p> Have you ever noticed that in between sleep and reality there lies a completely 
      different world in which you can exist? It lasts a breif moment in our minds 
      before our brains close our eyes from receiving images from sight. But still 
      things remain to be seen, whether from our eyes or by other means. Does 
      this mean they do not exist if they cannot be seen, or are they merely another 
      from of communication between the world and our own brains?</p>

      avoid their own feelings to fit a mold, whether they consider themselves 
      &quot;open-minded&quot;, but even these &quot;open-minded&quot; persons 
      fail to realize that choosing their own ways and expecting others to follow 
      them, even demanding this, have now entered their own realm of hypocracy 
      in forcing their beliefs on others. Are they truly, indeed, open-minded 
      then? </p>

      and what we believe to be right by reason. This notion of finding that connection 
      is what keeps us wandering...</p>
