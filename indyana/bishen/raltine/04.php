    <h1>The Wandering Hill</h1>
    <p>The king was very correct in thinking Menshin&#8217;s determination. Promptly 
      as the sun rose along the horizon, Menshin was dressed and prepared to lead 
      his small batch of men to the most western part of Mx&#8217;tiador&#8217;ol 
      in search for this rare creature.</p>
    <p>The night before, Torick gathered together three men, uncouth and unaware 
      of the procedure of chivalry, which gnawed on Menshin&#8217;s nerves. The 
      first man was a tall, buff scoundrel who wore only a loose fitting, leather 
      vest and a poor excuse for a pair of riding pants Menshin had ever seen. 
      His head glared in the sunlight of the early morning not only from the lack 
      of hair, but also from the grease condensed from poor eating habits and 
      not bathing. Drasooth, named after a southern pond of Mx&#8217;tiador&#8217;ol, 
      had a slack jaw and would drool from time to time if not reminded.</p>
    <p>The second man was more polite, but cowardly so. He was shorter than Menshin 
      and much weaker; he probably would have fit more appropriately with the 
      king&#8217;s servants than with potential battle men. Conversely to Drasooth, 
      Asado had a dirty mop of dark, brown hair that covered his entire top. Still 
      slightly too young to grow a full beard, Asado had a fine moustache and 
      goatee that Menshin imagined could blow off his face with a mere strike 
      of the wind.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, with a surprise was Jurrah, the single man who discovered him 
      on the open field. &#8220;I thought your job was in servitude?&#8221; Menshin 
      greeted Jurrah.</p>
    <p>&#8220;It is, but this job was open to all applicable, I have been looking 
      to remove myself from Mx&#8217;tiador&#8217;ol for some time now.&#8221;</p>
    <p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Menshin equivocated, pondering what Jurrah might 
      have meant by that comment. &#8220;Furthermore, glad to see you in our happy, 
      well, minor group.&#8221;</p>
