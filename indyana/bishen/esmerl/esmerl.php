    <p>Esmerl found his way into Rhul and somehow into the Sadlan River, lucky 
      for him, a young Hyyat found him and rescued his egg.</p>
    <p>She took great care of him and he owed his life to her. Whenever one of 
      her past suitors came after her and kidnapped her, Esmerl fought his way 
      to her and rescued her from a brutal beating.</p>
    <p>Out of breath and mortified by the damage he had done, Esmerl took Fallen 
      far away from her life and lived further out by the sea.</p>
    <p>In order to make peace with their lives, Esmerl and Fallen returned to 
      her hometown and to the place where she found Esmerl's little egg. Out of 
      the corner of his eyes, Esmerl spotted a glimmering white in the water. 
      He quickly swam and returned to the surface with it. In his mouth he carried 
      Fallen's lost pearl.</p>
    <p>She declared to him that she no longer needed this symbol of care, she 
      had that with Esmerl, and placed the necklace around his neck for him to 
      keep and protect.</p>
