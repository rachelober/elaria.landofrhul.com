    <p>Fallen lost her mother at a very early age and after this, her father was 
      not very much caring for her. This event has spurred they way she relates 
      to others and her constant look for a male companion, even at her young 
      age.</p>
    <p>This leads her into many of the beds of the local townfolk and running 
      a secret life outside of her hometown girl image that she presents to the 
      patrons that visit her father's market store.</p>
    <p>The only thing that she has inherited from her mother was a pearl on a 
      necklace. She got herself in trouble one day and found herself near the 
      Sadlan River and lost it among the current. Heartbroken she searched desprately 
      but instead found a strange rock. Looking closer, it was an egg.</p>
    <p>When the egg hatched, a tiny, defensely wyrm sputtered out. She kept him 
      secret, as she did many things and raised it by herself. She stopped visiting 
      her male friends and instead tried to find other things to do with her time.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, one of her male friends was very upset with this decision 
      and tracked her down...</p>
    <p>Through many trials, she grew into a woman with Esmerl by her side. The 
      quirky couple are spiteful and egotistical, but they get along very well 
      and look out for each other.</p>
