    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Hey everyone reading this, my name is Mirab. I am an older Eorlan than 
      has been in Rhul for a while, still haven't grown up yet, which isn't a 
      problem really. Being a pup still, you can weasel out of everything! *snickers 
      at Bright Promise* If I were an adult, I wouldn't have nearly the kind of 
      influence as I do now. Like Garret? He tries to get away with the dumbest 
      things! Bright Promise pulls out the lecture and <i>always</i> says, &quot;Garret! 
      You should know better! You're an <i>ADULT</i> for cryin' out loud!&quot; 
      Ha-ha!</p>
    <p>Besides my pup-ness, I am a Water elemental and loving it. I can't wait 
      to learn all those attacks out there for me to use!</p>
